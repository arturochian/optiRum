Bug fixes:

- Use of the data.table package was resulting in errors in generatePDF.  
Code has been amended to work under a new environment within the global package
- The generatePDF function did not correctly pass ... to internal functions.  
This has now been changed, primarily for the benefit of being able to compile with 
xelatex etc
